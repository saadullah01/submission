    "analysis": "1. Usage of exploit.py  \n   \u2022 The verifier does not craft its own payload.  \n   \u2022 It imports the existing exploit with `importlib.import_module(\"exploit\") / reload()` and invokes `exploit_module.main()`.  \n   \u2022 It supplies the single positional argument (10 000) by temporarily overwriting `sys.argv`.  \n   \u2714 Criterion-1 satisfied.\n\n2. Manipulation of project / exploit  \n   \u2022 The only \u201cmanipulation\u201d is a `pre_setup()` step that puts the repository root at the front of `sys.path` to guarantee the vulnerable copy of sqlparse is the one imported.  \n   \u2022 No code inside the exploit is altered, no monkey-patching of sqlparse occurs, and nothing is done to avoid actually exercising the vulnerability.  \n   \u2714 No malicious setup-skipping; criterion-2 satisfied.\n\n3. Pre / post verification logic  \n   Pre: merely ensures vulnerable version (<0.5.0) is importable \u2013 sufficient for this CVE.  \n   Post: considers exploit successful when  \n      \u2013 a `RecursionError` is raised, and  \n      \u2013 the traceback string contains \u201csqlparse/sql.py\u201d.  \n   This directly corresponds to the documented uncontrolled-recursion symptom; it also prevents false positives where RecursionError might arise elsewhere.  \n   \u2714 Logic is clear, automatic and not weak.\n\n4. Completeness / placeholders  \n   \u2022 The script is fully filled out, no TODO / placeholder markers remain.  \n   \u2022 All branches terminate with sys.exit and/or flag output.  \n   \u2714 Criterion-4 satisfied.\n\nOverall, the verifier meets all required conditions and produced the correct flag in the supplied run-time logs (\u201c3xploit66full\u201d on stdout).",
