    "analysis": "The repo-builder agent performed an actual setup, not a dummy description.  \n\u2022 It executed `pip3 install sqlparse==0.4.4`, fetching the vulnerable pre-built wheel, so no source modifications or vulnerability injection occurred.  \n\u2022 It verified Python version (3.10) and wrote a PoC script (`poc_dos.py`).  \n\u2022 It ran the PoC and obtained the expected `RecursionError`, proving the environment is using the vulnerable code path.  \n\u2022 No external services are required by sqlparse, so none had to be started.  \n\u2022 All work was done inside the Ubuntu VM with standard tools; no unsupported hardware/OS requirements exist.  \n\u2022 There is no sign of previous failed attempts or critic feedback blocks.  \nOverall, criteria 1-9 are satisfied: correct vulnerable version is installed, the PoC demonstrates the flaw, and no artificial vulnerability was added.",
