    "overview": "The project is \u201csqlparse,\u201d a non-validating SQL parser written in Python (requires Python 3.5+). The CVE (CVE-2024-4340) stems from the `TokenList.flatten()` method in sqlparse/sql.py in versions < 0.5.0 (notably 0.4.4), which performs unbounded recursion when flattening deeply nested token groups (e.g. nested square brackets). Passing a string of thousands of nested brackets to `sqlparse.parse()` causes Python\u2019s call stack to overflow with a `RecursionError`, resulting in a Denial of Service. The patch in 0.5.0 wraps the flatten loop in a try/except that catches `RecursionError` and raises a controlled `SQLParseError`.",
    "files": "1. pyproject.toml  \n   - Declares project metadata, Python requirement (>=3.5), and build-system (flit_core).  \n   - Defines optional dev/test dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov).  \n   - The next agent should use this to create a virtual environment and install sqlparse==0.4.4 via pip (no source build necessary).\n2. sqlparse/sql.py  \n   - Contains the vulnerable `TokenList.flatten()` implementation (lines ~200\u2013220).  \n   - The agent can inspect this to understand where unbounded recursion occurs.\n3. Proof-of-Concept script (not present, must be created)  \n   - A minimal Python script that imports sqlparse, builds a payload of `'[' * 10000 + ']' * 10000`, and calls `sqlparse.parse(payload)`.\n4. (Optional) tests/  \n   - The existing test suite helps validate environment correctness but is not required to reproduce the CVE.",
    "services": "None. This is a standalone Python library. No external services or network configuration is required.",
    "output": "1. After creating a Python 3.5+ virtual environment and installing sqlparse==0.4.4:\n   \u2022 Running the PoC script should terminate with a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`, demonstrating the uncontrolled recursion DoS.  \n2. (For comparison) Upgrading to sqlparse>=0.5.0 changes the script to raise `sqlparse.exceptions.SQLParseError('Maximum recursion depth exceeded')`, showing the controlled failure."
